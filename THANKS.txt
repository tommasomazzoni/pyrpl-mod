PyRPL is open source software that allows to use FPGA boards with
analog interfaces for measurement and control of real-world devices in
physics and engineering, notably experiments in quantum optics. It was
started in 2014 by Leonhard Neuhaus for controlling experiments in physics at
the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel in Paris, France. Its was initially based on
the open-source code for the Red Pitaya (www.redpitaya.com) and gradually
diverged away from it. In 2016, large parts of the graphical user interface
were added to the project by Samuel Deleglise. A number of additional people
have since contributed to PyRPL by discussing with us, testing, bug reporting,
or small changes to the code or documentation. Below is a partial list. If
you've been left off, please change this file by yourself or send an email
to the maintainer (currently neuhaus@lkb.upmc.fr).
